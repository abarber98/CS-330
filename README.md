# How do I approach designing software?

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

  This project has helped me craft skills with graphic design. This was my first introduction to OpenGL and working in a 3D space. 
  
## What design process did you follow for your project work?

  I took small steps and applied a lot of trial and error to get my meshes placed right
  
## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  This class taught me a lot about patience and problem solving. A lot of the time in previous coding classes I would fall into rabbit holes to find a fix for my code. However, this class was a more straight forward approach in trial and error. I built confidence in myself that I could build
  the program and trouble shoot affectively as I came into the milestones with a lot of knowledge from the weekly assignments. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
  
## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I references a lot of working examples in this project. I used the OpenGL sample as my framework and benchmark for my own project.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

With each milestone, I was adding more and more functionality and polish to the project. Over time it took many steps and iterations to become a cohesive project.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My understanding of OpenGL continually improved with each milestone. I grew confidence as my scene began to look better and better. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

It taught me valuable skills about how I can approach seemingly hard tasks. I was initially overwhelmed and intimidated by this class. However with proper time management and devotion to learning, I was able to overcome these challenges. 

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

If I were to want to go into game development or building 3D models for companies, this was a great introduction. I can use these skills and apply them to different frameworks and projects in my future career.
